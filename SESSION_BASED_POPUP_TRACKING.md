# Session-Based Welcome Popup Tracking

## Overview

Implemented session-based tracking for welcome popups to ensure they only appear once per browser session, not on every page navigation.

## Problem Solved

Previously, welcome popups would appear every time a user navigated to a page that included the `WelcomeDialog` component. The `hasInitialized` flag only prevented re-showing within a single component mount, but reset when navigating between pages.

## Solution Implemented

Added sessionStorage-based tracking to persist popup visibility state across page navigations within the same browser session.

## Changes Made

### File: `src/hooks/useWelcomePopup.ts`

#### 1. Added Session Storage Helper Functions

```typescript
// Session storage helpers for tracking shown popups
const SESSION_STORAGE_PREFIX = 'welcome-popup-shown-';

function hasFlowBeenShownThisSession(flowType: WelcomeFlowType): boolean {
  if (!flowType || flowType === 'chat-recipe') return false;
  try {
    return (
      sessionStorage.getItem(`${SESSION_STORAGE_PREFIX}${flowType}`) === 'true'
    );
  } catch {
    // sessionStorage might not be available (e.g., in some privacy modes)
    return false;
  }
}

function markFlowAsShown(flowType: WelcomeFlowType): void {
  if (!flowType || flowType === 'chat-recipe') return;
  try {
    sessionStorage.setItem(`${SESSION_STORAGE_PREFIX}${flowType}`, 'true');
  } catch {
    // Silently fail if sessionStorage is not available
  }
}
```

#### 2. Updated Initialization Logic

Modified the `useEffect` hook to check sessionStorage before showing popups:

```typescript
// Check if this flow has already been shown this session
const alreadyShownThisSession = hasFlowBeenShownThisSession(flow);
const shouldShowPopup = flow !== null && !alreadyShownThisSession;

setShouldShow(shouldShowPopup);
```

#### 3. Updated dismissPopup Function

Now marks the flow as shown in sessionStorage when dismissed:

```typescript
const dismissPopup = useCallback(() => {
  setShouldShow(false);
  // Mark this flow as shown in sessionStorage to prevent re-showing on other pages
  markFlowAsShown(flowType);
}, [flowType]);
```

#### 4. Updated disablePopupPermanently Function

Also marks the flow as shown in sessionStorage when permanently disabled:

```typescript
// Mark as shown in session storage as well
markFlowAsShown(flowType);
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Chat-Recipe Context

The chat-recipe flow is explicitly excluded from session tracking because it's a functional dialog for chef selection, not an informational welcome popup. It should show every time the user needs to select a chef.

### 2. "Don't Show Again" Checkbox

The database-backed permanent disable preference (`show_welcome_popup: false`) continues to work as before and takes precedence over session tracking.

### 3. Session Expiration

SessionStorage automatically clears when the browser tab/window is closed, so popups will show again in a new session.

### 4. SessionStorage Unavailability

Try-catch blocks handle cases where sessionStorage is not available (e.g., some browser privacy modes), gracefully falling back to showing the popup.

### 5. Backward Compatibility

All existing logic is preserved:

- `hasInitialized` flag for preventing re-renders within same mount
- Database-backed `show_welcome_popup` preference
- Visit count and flow determination logic

## SessionStorage Keys

The following keys are used in sessionStorage:

- `welcome-popup-shown-first-time`
- `welcome-popup-shown-welcome-back`
- `welcome-popup-shown-quick-nav`

Note: `chat-recipe` flow does not use sessionStorage.

## Testing

- ✅ All 679 existing tests pass
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ ESLint passes with no errors
- ✅ No linter errors introduced

## Behavior

1. **First page visit in session**: Popup shows if conditions are met
2. **User dismisses popup**: Marked in sessionStorage
3. **Navigate to another page**: Popup does not show (sessionStorage prevents it)
4. **Close browser tab/window**: SessionStorage cleared
5. **Open new tab/window**: Popup shows again (new session)
