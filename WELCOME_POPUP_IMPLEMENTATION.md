# Welcome Popup System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

A progressive welcome popup system that guides users based on their visit patterns and preferences.

## Implementation Completed ✅

### 1. Database Migration

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251028000001_add_welcome_popup_tracking.sql`

- Added `visit_count`, `last_visit_at`, and `show_welcome_popup` columns to profiles table
- Created indexes for efficient querying
- Added helpful comments for database documentation

### 2. Type Definitions

**File:** `src/lib/types.ts`

- Updated `Profile` type to include new welcome popup tracking fields

### 3. Hook Implementation

**File:** `src/hooks/useWelcomePopup.ts`

- Detects user visit patterns (first-time, returning, frequent)
- Increments visit count on each app load
- Handles popup dismissal and permanent disabling
- Respects user preferences

**Detection Logic:**

- Visit count ≤ 1: First-time welcome flow
- Last visit > 7 days ago: Welcome back flow
- Visit count ≥ 10: Quick navigation flow
- User disabled popup: No display

### 4. Welcome Flow Components

**File:** `src/components/welcome/FirstTimeWelcome.tsx`

- Warm, encouraging greeting
- Two clear action buttons:
  - Create My First Recipe → `/add`
  - Explore Other Creations → `/explore`

- Visually hidden titles and descriptions

### 5. Integration

**File:** `src/pages/recipes-page.tsx`

- Added WelcomeDialog to main recipes page

- Visit count increments on page load

### 6. Profile Settings

**File:** `src/components/profile/preferences/AppPreferencesCard.tsx`

- New App Preferences section in profile page

## Mobile Responsiveness ✅

### Design Decisions for Mobile

1. **Dialog Component**: Uses Radix UI Dialog which is mobile-optimized by default
2. **Button Layout**: Buttons stack vertically on mobile devices
3. **Touch Targets**: All buttons meet minimum 44x44px touch target size
4. **Responsive Classes**: Uses Tailwind responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:)
5. **Text Sizing**: Readable text sizes on mobile (text-sm, text-base)
6. **Spacing**: Adequate padding and gap utilities for touch interfaces

### Component-Specific Mobile Features

**FirstTimeWelcome:**

- Full-width buttons with proper spacing
- Icon + text layout that scales well
- Subtitle text size adjusted for mobile readability

**WelcomeBackFlow:**

- Navigation buttons stack vertically on mobile
- Recent activity cards are touch-friendly

**AppPreferencesCard:**

- Responsive grid layout (md:grid-cols-2)
- Switch control is touch-friendly
- Description text wraps properly

## Accessibility ✅

### Keyboard Navigation

- All dialogs support ESC key to close
- Tab navigation through all interactive elements
- Enter key activates buttons

### Screen Readers

- Visually hidden DialogTitle and DialogDescription
- Proper ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Semantic HTML structure
- Label associations for form controls

### Visual Accessibility

- High contrast text (gray-900 on white, etc.)
- Clear focus indicators (from Radix UI Dialog)
- Icon + text labels (not icon-only buttons)
- Loading states with spinner + text

### Motion Preferences

- Uses existing Dialog animations which respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- No custom animations added

## Chef Personality Integration (Chat Recipe Page)

### Overview

The chat-recipe page has a specialized welcome flow that lets users select a chef personality before starting their recipe creation session.

### Chef Personalities Available

1. **Chef Marco** (`chef-marco`) → Maps to `chef` persona
   - Traditional techniques
   - Mediterranean cuisine expert
   - Icon: ChefHat with orange/red gradient

2. **Dr. Sarah** (`dr-sarah`) → Maps to `nutritionist` persona
   - Dietitian & nutrition expert
   - Healthy eating focus
   - Icon: Stethoscope with green/teal gradient

3. **Aunt Jenny** (`aunt-jenny`) → Maps to `homeCook` persona
   - Home cook specializing in comfort foods
   - Family-friendly recipes
   - Icon: Home with purple/pink gradient

### How It Works

1. User navigates to `/chat-recipe`
2. **Chef Selection Popup** appears automatically (via `context="chat-recipe"`)
3. User selects their preferred chef personality (or skips)
4. **Instructions Modal** appears explaining how to use the AI assistant
5. User reads instructions about:
   - Recipe Preferences selector (optional)
   - Profile data being pre-loaded
   - How to chat with the assistant
   - Example prompts for inspiration
6. Selection is mapped to PersonaType and passed to ChatInterface
7. AI assistant responds with the selected chef's personality and expertise

### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Chef ID to Persona mapping in chat-recipe-page.tsx
const CHEF_TO_PERSONA_MAP: Record<string, PersonaType> = {
  'chef-marco': 'chef',
  'dr-sarah': 'nutritionist',
  'aunt-jenny': 'homeCook',
};

// Pass selected persona to ChatInterface
<ChatInterface
  onRecipeGenerated={handleRecipeGenerated}
  defaultPersona={selectedPersona}
/>
```

### Chat Instructions Modal

The instructions modal appears after chef selection to guide new users on how to effectively use the AI chat interface. It includes:

**Key Features:**

  - Get creative suggestions ("healthy dinner for busy weeknight")
  - Request variations ("How can I make lasagna vegetarian?")
- ✅ "Don't show again" checkbox (stored in localStorage)
- ✅ Personalized with selected chef's name

**Storage:** Uses localStorage key `hideChatInstructionsModal` to remember user preference

### Explore Page Instructions Modal

The Explore page has its own standalone instructions modal that appears on first visit to help users understand the community features.

**Key Features:**

**Pro Tips:**

- Customize after saving (ingredients, servings, notes)
- Use sort options to find trending or highly-rated recipes

**Storage:** Uses localStorage key `hideExploreInstructionsModal` to remember user preference

### Recipe View Instructions Modal

The Recipe View pages (`/recipe/:id` and `/view-recipe/:id`) include an instructions modal to help users understand the smart grocery features.

**Key Features:**

- ✅ Explains grocery compatibility scoring
- ✅ How to add missing ingredients to collection
- ✅ How to create and export shopping lists
- ✅ How to add notes and rate recipes
- ✅ Four pro tips explaining icons and features:

  - Toggle ingredients between "needed" and "available"
- ✅ "Don't show again" checkbox (stored in localStorage)

**Instruction Sections:**

1. **Check Your Grocery Compatibility** - Understand the percentage match and what you have
2. **Add Missing Ingredients** - Use + Add buttons to build your grocery collection
3. **Create Shopping Lists** - Auto-generated shopping list and export features
4. **Add Notes & Rate Recipes** - Personalize with notes and leave ratings

**Storage:** Uses localStorage key `hideRecipeViewInstructionsModal` to remember user preference

### Context-Based Flow Selection

The welcome system uses a `context` parameter to determine which flow to show:

- **`context="general"`** (default) - Shows visit-based flows (first-time, welcome-back, quick-nav)
- **`context="chat-recipe"`** - Always shows chef selection + instructions modal
- **Explore page** - Uses standalone `ExploreInstructionsModal` (appears on first visit)
- **Recipe view pages** - Uses standalone `RecipeViewInstructionsModal` (appears on first visit)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run database migration
2. ✅ Test all user flows in development
3. ✅ Integrate chef selection with AI chat interface
4. Test mobile responsiveness on actual devices
5. Test accessibility with screen reader
6. Deploy to staging for QA testing
7. Monitor user engagement metrics
8. Track which chef personalities are most popular

## Success Metrics to Track
