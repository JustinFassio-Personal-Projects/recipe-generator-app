## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Integration Strategy

**Zero-Disruption Enhancement**
The shopping cart leverages existing systems with minimal additions:

- **Database**: Uses existing `user_groceries` table + optional `recipe_context` JSON column
- **Hooks**: Extends existing `useGroceries` hook with cart-specific methods
- **UI**: New `/cart` page using existing ingredient components
- **API**: Reuses existing grocery management endpoints

**Data Flow Architecture**

```
Recipe Missing Ingredients → Add to user_groceries → Cart Page Display → Shopping Mode
```

### Key Technical Components

**Database (Minimal Changes)**

```sql
-- Add shopping list context to existing table
ALTER TABLE user_groceries
ADD COLUMN shopping_list JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
ADD COLUMN shopping_contexts JSONB DEFAULT '{}';

-- Structure:
-- shopping_list: {"ingredient_name": "pending|purchased"}
-- shopping_contexts: {"ingredient_name": {
--   "sources": ["recipe_id", "ai_chat", "groceries_restock"],
--   "quantities": ["2 cups", "1 lb"],
--   "notes": "Need more for multiple recipes"
-- }}
```

**Enhanced Hooks**

- `useShoppingList` (extends `useGroceries`):
  - `addToShoppingList(ingredient, source, context)`
  - `getShoppingList()` - returns pending items with contexts
  - `markAsPurchased(ingredient)`
  - `clearPurchased()` - removes completed items
  - `getShoppingCount()` - for header badge

- `useShoppingCartAI`:
  - `analyzeCuisinePatterns(shoppingList)` - detects cuisine from ingredients
  - `getSuggestions(detectedCuisines)` - returns authentic staples
  - `addStaplesToGroceries(staples)` - bulk add to My Groceries
  - `getCulturalContext(ingredient)` - provides cooking tips and usage

**Multi-Source Integration**

- **Recipe Views**: "Add Missing to Shopping List" buttons
- **AI Chat**: "Add Ingredients to Shopping List" in AI responses
- **Public Recipes**: "Save & Add to Shopping List" action
- **My Groceries**: "Add Out-of-Stock to Shopping List" bulk action
- **Header Badge**: Persistent shopping list counter across all pages

**AI-Powered Shopping Features**

- **Cuisine Detection**: Analyzes cart contents to identify cooking patterns
- **Authentic Staples**: Suggests essential ingredients for detected cuisines
- **Cultural Context**: Provides usage tips and traditional preparation methods
- **Long-term Planning**: Recommends ingredients to add to regular grocery inventory
- **Context Preservation**: Shows ingredient sources and quantities
- **Smart Deduplication**: Combines same ingredients from different sources
- **Mobile Shopping Mode**: Store-section organized checklist
