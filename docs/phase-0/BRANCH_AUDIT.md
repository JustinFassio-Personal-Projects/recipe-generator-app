# Phase 0 â€“ Recipe Description: Branch Audit

## Summary

- Scope violation: edits to src/lib/supabase.ts despite guardrails.
- Emergency reverts indicate instability in a feature branch.
- Build passes with dynamic/static import warnings; lint shows 24 warnings.
- Current code already threads description through schema, parsers, and UI; DB persistence appears partial.

## Evidence

- Commits touching supabase.ts: reverts and env validation churn.
- Diff vs origin/main shows only two files modified on this branch (doc + supabase.ts).
- Lint warnings are unrelated but add noise.

## Lessons

- Keep infra/env out of feature branches.
- Ship in additive, scoped PRs; avoid broad refactors.
- Prefer docs-first plan with explicit guardrails.
