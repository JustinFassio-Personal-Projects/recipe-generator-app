# Bug Fixes & Refactoring Plans

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for bug fixes, refactoring efforts, and technical debt resolution. Each document represents a specific issue or improvement area that was identified during development.

## Branch Analysis: `feature/debug-production-csp-errors`

This documentation was created by analyzing the `feature/debug-production-csp-errors` branch, which attempted to fix multiple issues simultaneously. We learned valuable lessons about scope management and incremental improvement.

### Key Lesson Learned

**Don't mix bug fixes with major refactoring in a single branch.** This creates:

- Review complexity
- TypeScript errors that compound
- Difficult rollback scenarios
- Merge conflicts
- Lost work when branches need to be abandoned

## Documentation Structure

Each bug fix or improvement is documented in its own file with the following information:

1. **Problem Statement** - What issue are we solving?
2. **Root Cause** - Why does this issue exist?
3. **Proposed Solution** - How will we fix it?
4. **Implementation Plan** - Step-by-step approach
5. **Success Criteria** - How do we know it's fixed?
6. **Dependencies** - What needs to happen first?
7. **Lessons Learned** - What did we learn from previous attempts?

## Current Issues

### 🟢 Ready to Implement (Quick Wins)

- [CSP and Image Handling Fixes](./csp-and-image-handling.md) - **Priority 1**
- [Migration Utility Scripts](./migration-scripts.md) - **Priority 2**

### 🟡 Needs Planning (Refactoring)

- [API Modularization](./api-refactoring.md) - Major refactoring effort
- [Image Gallery System](./image-gallery-system.md) - New feature implementation

### 🔴 Blocked (Dependencies)

- [Rating API Type Safety](./rating-api-types.md) - Depends on API modularization

## Extraction Status

### Phase 1: Quick Wins ✅

- [x] CSP policy fixes
- [x] Image URL handling
- [x] Picsum.photos migration
- [ ] **ACTION NEEDED**: Cherry-pick to new branch

### Phase 2: Utility Scripts ✅

- [x] Migration scripts identified
- [ ] **ACTION NEEDED**: Extract to separate branch

### Phase 3: API Refactoring 📋

- [x] Lessons documented
- [x] Blueprint created
- [ ] **ACTION NEEDED**: Implement incrementally (see [api-refactoring.md](./api-refactoring.md))

### Phase 4: Image Gallery 📋

- [x] Requirements documented
- [ ] **ACTION NEEDED**: Implement on stable base (see [image-gallery-system.md](./image-gallery-system.md))

## Workflow

### For New Bug Fixes

1. Create a new markdown file in this directory
2. Use the template in [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md)
3. Link it from this README
4. Create a focused branch for the fix
5. Keep the branch small and reviewable

### For Refactoring Work

1. Document the current state
2. Create a blueprint for the desired state
3. Break it into small, incremental steps
4. Each step should be independently deployable
5. Maintain backward compatibility

### For Feature Additions

1. Document the feature requirements
2. Define the API/interface first
3. Implement in layers (types → API → hooks → components)
4. Add tests at each layer
5. Keep the PR focused on one feature

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- Create small, focused branches (< 500 lines changed)
- Write types before implementation
- Add tests for new functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility during refactoring
- Document lessons learned
- Cherry-pick clean commits when possible

### ❌ DON'T

- Mix bug fixes with refactoring
- Make breaking changes without migration path
- Skip TypeScript compilation checks
- Commit code with failing tests
- Create branches with multiple unrelated changes

## Questions or Issues?

If you're unsure whether to:

- Fix a bug immediately vs. document it first → **Fix critical bugs immediately, document patterns**
- Split a change into multiple PRs → **When in doubt, split it**
- Refactor while fixing a bug → **Separate the refactoring into its own PR**

## Maintenance

This documentation should be:

- Updated when new bugs are identified
- Archived when fixes are merged
- Referenced in PR descriptions
- Reviewed during retrospectives
