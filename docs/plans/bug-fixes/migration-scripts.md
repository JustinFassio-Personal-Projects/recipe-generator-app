# Migration Utility Scripts

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Ready to Extract  
**Priority:** P2 Medium  
**Type:** Tooling/Infrastructure  
**Estimated Effort:** XS (< 2 hours)  
**Created:** 2025-10-07  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-07

## Problem Statement

### What is the issue?

During development of the `feature/debug-production-csp-errors` branch, three valuable utility scripts were created for database maintenance and diagnostics. These scripts are currently trapped in an unmerged branch but provide standalone value.

### Scripts Created

1. **`migrate-picsum-images.js`** - Replace picsum.photos URLs with local placeholders
2. **`migrate-dalle-images.js`** - Migrate DALL-E 2 URLs to DALL-E 3 format
3. **`diagnose-database-issues.js`** - Diagnostic tool for database connectivity and schema issues

### When was it discovered?

- Created during CSP and image handling fixes
- Identified as valuable standalone utilities
- Currently on `feature/debug-production-csp-errors` branch (commit `7b57dbc` and related)

### Impact Assessment

- **Users Affected:** Development team and database administrators
- **Severity:** Medium (improves maintainability and debugging)
- **Workaround Available:** Manual database queries (time-consuming and error-prone)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why were these scripts needed?

1. **migrate-picsum-images.js**
   - Seed data historically used external picsum.photos service
   - CSP policy changes required migration to local resources
   - Needed bulk update capability for existing database records

2. **migrate-dalle-images.js**
   - OpenAI deprecated DALL-E 2 API
   - Existing image URLs in database using old format
   - Needed migration path to DALL-E 3 URLs

3. **diagnose-database-issues.js**
   - Complex database setup with multiple schemas and policies
   - Debugging connection issues difficult without tooling
   - Needed systematic diagnostic capability

### Contributing Factors

- Lack of existing migration script infrastructure
- No standardized database diagnostic tools
- Ad-hoc approach to schema changes

## Proposed Solution

### High-Level Approach

Extract these scripts to a dedicated branch and merge them as standalone utilities, independent of the CSP fixes.

### Technical Details

**Script Capabilities:**

1. **migrate-picsum-images.js** (118 lines)
   - Connects to Supabase database
   - Finds all records with picsum.photos URLs
   - Replaces with local placeholder (`/recipe-generator-logo.png`)
   - Provides dry-run mode for safety
   - Logs all changes for audit trail

2. **migrate-dalle-images.js** (168 lines)
   - Identifies DALL-E 2 format URLs
   - Converts to DALL-E 3 format
   - Handles various URL patterns
   - Includes error handling and rollback
   - Reports success/failure metrics

3. **diagnose-database-issues.js** (199 lines)
   - Tests database connectivity
   - Validates schema existence
   - Checks RLS policies
   - Verifies table permissions
   - Outputs detailed diagnostic report

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Include in CSP branch**
   - Pros: Related to image handling
   - Cons: Couples utility scripts with bug fixes
   - **Rejected:** Scripts have independent value

2. **Manual database operations**
   - Pros: No code needed
   - Cons: Error-prone, not repeatable
   - **Rejected:** Doesn't scale, hard to audit

3. **Use database GUI tools**
   - Pros: Visual interface
   - Cons: Not scriptable, no version control
   - **Rejected:** Lacks automation and documentation

**Chosen Approach:** Extract scripts to separate branch because they provide standalone value and may be needed regardless of CSP fixes.

## Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Review scripts for any dependencies on CSP branch changes
- [ ] Ensure scripts work with current main branch database schema
- [ ] Add documentation/comments where needed

### Steps

1. **Create Utility Scripts Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b chore/add-migration-utilities main
   ```

2. **Manually Copy Scripts** (cherry-pick would cause conflicts)

   ```bash
   # From feature/debug-production-csp-errors, copy these files:
   # - scripts/migrate-picsum-images.js
   # - scripts/migrate-dalle-images.js
   # - scripts/diagnose-database-issues.js
   ```

3. **Add Documentation**
   - Create `scripts/migrations/README.md`
   - Document usage for each script
   - Add safety warnings and best practices

4. **Add Safety Features**
   - Ensure all scripts have dry-run mode
   - Add confirmation prompts for destructive operations
   - Include backup recommendations

5. **Test Scripts**
   - Test on local database
   - Verify dry-run mode works
   - Confirm actual migrations work
   - Test rollback procedures

### Code Changes

#### Files to Create

- `scripts/migrations/migrate-picsum-images.js` - Picsum URL migration
- `scripts/migrations/migrate-dalle-images.js` - DALL-E URL migration
- `scripts/diagnostics/diagnose-database-issues.js` - Database diagnostic tool
- `scripts/migrations/README.md` - Migration script documentation
- `scripts/diagnostics/README.md` - Diagnostic tool documentation

#### Files to Modify

- `package.json` - Add script commands for convenience:
  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "migrate:picsum": "node scripts/migrations/migrate-picsum-images.js",
      "migrate:dalle": "node scripts/migrations/migrate-dalle-images.js",
      "diagnose:db": "node scripts/diagnostics/diagnose-database-issues.js"
    }
  }
  ```

### Testing Strategy

#### Script Testing Checklist

**migrate-picsum-images.js:**

- [ ] Dry-run mode displays correct records to update
- [ ] Actual run updates only intended records
- [ ] No unintended side effects
- [ ] Logging captures all changes
- [ ] Works with production credentials

**migrate-dalle-images.js:**

- [ ] Correctly identifies DALL-E 2 URLs
- [ ] Conversion logic produces valid DALL-E 3 URLs
- [ ] Handles edge cases (null URLs, malformed URLs)
- [ ] Rollback works if needed
- [ ] Reports accurate statistics

**diagnose-database-issues.js:**

- [ ] Connects to database successfully

## Migration Path

### Breaking Changes

None - these are new utility scripts

### Backward Compatibility

Not applicable - new additions only

### Rollback Plan

If scripts cause issues, simply don't run them. They can be removed from the repository without impacting application functionality.

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] All three scripts execute successfully
- [ ] Scripts have dry-run modes
- [ ] Clear documentation provided
- [ ] Package.json commands added
- [ ] Error handling robust

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                   | Probability | Impact   | Mitigation                                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Script corrupts data   | Low         | Critical | Dry-run mode, backup requirements, transaction support |
| Database timeout       | Medium      | Low      | Add connection retry logic, increase timeout           |
| Permission issues      | Low         | Medium   | Document required permissions, test with service role  |
| Script incompatibility | Low         | Medium   | Test on local DB first, version control all changes    |

## Lessons Learned

### From Previous Attempts

- Creating utilities during feature development is valuable
- Scripts should be extracted and shared early
- Good documentation prevents misuse
- Safety features (dry-run, confirmations) are essential

### Key Insights

1. **Utility scripts have value independent of features**
2. **Migration scripts should be versioned and documented**
3. **Diagnostic tools save debugging time**
4. **Dry-run mode is non-negotiable**
5. **Clear logging enables audit trails**

### Future Improvements

1. Create migration script template
2. Establish migration script naming convention
3. Add migration tracking table (which migrations ran when)
4. Create standardized logging format
5. Build CLI tool for running migrations
