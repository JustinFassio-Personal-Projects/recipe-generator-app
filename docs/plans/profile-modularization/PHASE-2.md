---

## Target Structure for Phase 2

### ✅ Hooks under `src/hooks/profile/` (completed):

- ✅ `useUserSafety.ts` (load/save allergies, dietary, medical)
- ✅ `useCookingPreferences.ts` (load/save cooking preferences)
- ✅ `useUsernameAvailability.ts` (debounced checker)
- ✅ `useProfileBasics.ts` (region/language/units/time/skill)
- ✅ `useAvatarUpload.ts` (avatar upload management)
- ✅ `useBioUpdate.ts` (specialized bio update hook)
- ✅ `useAccountManagement.ts` (email/password updates)

### Lib stays as is:

- `src/lib/user-preferences.ts` (already central)
- `src/lib/auth.ts` (profile updates, avatar, username)

### ✅ Page became a thin orchestrator:

- `src/pages/profile-page.tsx` (313 lines, down from 494):
  - ✅ Tabs + layout shell
  - ✅ Composes atomic cards/sections
  - ✅ Minimal local state; delegates to hooks/components
  - ✅ All direct state management removed
  - ✅ All API calls delegated to hooks
