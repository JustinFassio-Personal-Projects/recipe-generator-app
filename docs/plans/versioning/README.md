# Recipe Versioning System Documentation

## Complete Guide to Production-Ready Versioning

### 📖 **Overview**

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for implementing a production-ready recipe versioning system that leverages Supabase's built-in tools and follows industry best practices.

**The Problem:** Current system treats versions as separate recipe entities, causing duplicate entries in recipe lists and complex parent-child traversal logic.

**The Solution:** Implement proper temporal versioning with single recipe entities and historical version snapshots.

## 🛠 **Technical Architecture Comparison**

### **Current (Broken) Architecture**

```
recipes table:
├── Zucchini Noodles v1 (id: 1, parent_recipe_id: null)
├── Zucchini Noodles v2 (id: 2, parent_recipe_id: 1)
└── Zucchini Noodles v3 (id: 3, parent_recipe_id: 2)

Problems:
❌ Duplicate recipe entries
❌ Complex parent-child traversal
❌ Poor query performance
❌ No audit trail
❌ Difficult to maintain
```

### **Target (Production) Architecture**

```
recipes table:
└── Zucchini Noodles (id: 1, current_version_id: v3)

recipe_content_versions table:
├── v1: full content snapshot + metadata
├── v2: full content snapshot + metadata
└── v3: full content snapshot + metadata (published)

audit.recipe_audit_log table:
├── CREATE v1: timestamp, user, changes
├── UPDATE v2: timestamp, user, changes
└── PUBLISH v3: timestamp, user, changes

Benefits:
✅ Single recipe entry per logical entity
✅ Simple direct queries
✅ Excellent performance with proper indexing
✅ Complete audit trail
✅ Leverages Supabase built-in tools
✅ Scalable to thousands of versions
```

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Step 1: Assess Your Situation**

```bash
# Check current recipe count and complexity
psql -h your-host -p 5432 -U postgres -d your-db -c "
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_recipes,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE parent_recipe_id IS NULL) as original_recipes,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE parent_recipe_id IS NOT NULL) as version_recipes,
  MAX(version_number) as max_version_number
FROM recipes;
"
```
