# Supabase Database Implementation Plan

## Overview

Clean implementation of the Recipe Generator's Supabase database to support the completed profile modularization system. This is a fresh build - no emergency fixes needed.

## Current Status: Ready for Clean Implementation

The profile modularization is complete with all components built. Now we implement the database layer that supports this architecture.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Database Setup (Day 1)

**File**: `phase-1-core-database-setup.md`

- Set up basic tables: profiles, user_safety, cooking_preferences
- Implement Row Level Security policies
- Create storage buckets for avatars

### Phase 2: Recipe Media Enhancement (Day 2)

**File**: `phase-2-recipe-media-enhancement.md`

- Add video support to recipes (simple approach)
- Enhance storage buckets and policies
- Update API for video uploads

### Phase 3: Performance & Testing (Day 3)

**File**: `phase-3-performance-testing.md`

- Add strategic database indexes
- Create testing infrastructure for Phase 4 profile tests
- Performance validation

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Profile system fully functional with database persistence
- ✅ Recipe storage with image and video support
- ✅ Authentication and authorization working
- ✅ Performance targets met (<200ms profile loads)
- ✅ Testing infrastructure ready for Phase 4

## Architecture Principles

- **Keep it Simple**: Follow existing MVP patterns
- **Feature-Complete**: Support all profile modularization components
- **Performance-Ready**: Strategic indexing without over-optimization
- **Test-Enabled**: Support comprehensive testing infrastructure

Each phase builds on the previous and can be deployed independently.
